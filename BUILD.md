# ASuite building instructions

## Delphi version
Delphi 10.3 is required for building ASuite. Older Delphi versions will most likely fail; newer Delphi versions may work or fail. Unfortunately, Lazarus or one of the other free compilers cannot currently compile ASuite.

## Third party components
Once Delphi is installed, you need to install these components:
- VirtualTree https://github.com/Virtual-TreeView/Virtual-TreeView
- mORMot http://synopse.info/fossil/wiki?name=SQLite3+Framework
- DKLang http://yktoo.com/en/software/dklang
- cyComponents8 http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcycomponents/
- JCL + JVCL https://github.com/project-jedi
- TPJVersionInfo http://www.delphidabbler.com/software?id=verinfo
- System Information Unit http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/sysinfo?mid=3.2
